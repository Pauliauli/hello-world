First steps into the brave world of JS!

Hi awesome people!

This is me, Paula, account manager in London for a company which sells apps for online shops to increase the conversion rate. I'm not too bad at account management but to be honest I don't have a clue what the guys in our tech and development department are up to. That's why I'm trying to learn a bit about JS and stuff. Hopefully one day, I will laugh about these lines and fully understand the how's and why's of our tech and development department.
One day!

Challenge accepted.
